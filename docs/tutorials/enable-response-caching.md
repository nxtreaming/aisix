title: Enable Response Caching
description: Enable prompt-response caching in AISIX AI Gateway and verify cache hit and miss behavior using the x-aisix-cache header.

This tutorial turns on the chat-completion cache so identical caller requests are served from the cache instead of forwarding to the upstream, and verifies the result with the `x-aisix-cache` response header.

You end with one enabled `CachePolicy` and a reproducible header-level proof that the cache works.

## Prerequisites

- A running gateway from the [Self-Hosted Quickstart](../quickstart/self-hosted.md)
- A direct model and caller API key from the [First Model, First Key, First Request](../quickstart/first-model-first-key-first-request.md) quickstart — this tutorial reuses `gpt-4o-prod` and `sk-demo-caller` as canonical names
- The caller key must include the model in `allowed_models` (or be a wildcard `["*"]`)

## How It Works

The proxy keys each request on a fingerprint built from the resolved model alias, the caller key, and the request body. When an enabled `CachePolicy` matches the request, the proxy:

1. computes the fingerprint
2. looks up the cache
3. on **miss**, dispatches to the upstream, writes the response into the cache, returns the response with `x-aisix-cache: miss`
4. on **hit**, returns the cached response without calling the upstream, with `x-aisix-cache: hit`

If no enabled policy matches, the cache gate stays closed and the response has no `x-aisix-cache` header.

## Step 1: Create The Cache Policy

```bash title="Create the cache policy"
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/cache_policies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "default-chat-cache",
    "enabled": true,
    "applies_to": "all",
    "ttl_seconds": 3600
  }'
```

Field meanings (full reference in [Caching](../configuration/caching.md)):

- `enabled: true` — the cache gate consults this policy on every request
- `applies_to: "all"` — matches every request. For targeted rollouts use `model:<display_name>` or `api_key:<api_key_id>`.
- `ttl_seconds: 3600` — cache entry lifetime hint. Defaults to `3600` if omitted.
- `backend: "memory"` is the default. The standalone gateway enforces `memory`; `redis` parses and persists but currently falls back to memory until the backend wires up.

Wait for the snapshot to propagate:

```bash title="Wait for propagation"
sleep 1
```

If the Step 2 call returns no `x-aisix-cache` header on a slow runner, the policy has not propagated yet. See [Wait for configuration propagation](../quickstart/first-model-first-key-first-request.md#step-4-wait-for-configuration-propagation) for the polling alternative.

## Step 2: Send The First Request — Cache Miss

The proxy emits the `x-aisix-cache` header on every response that participates in the cache path. `curl -i` prints headers so we can see it directly.

```bash title="First call — should report cache miss"
curl -sSi -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo-caller" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-prod",
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"cached prompt"}]
  }'
```

Look for this line in the response headers:

```text
x-aisix-cache: miss
```

`miss` means the gateway dispatched to the upstream and wrote the response into the cache.

## Step 3: Send The Same Request Again — Cache Hit

Repeat the **exact same** request body, model alias, and bearer:

```bash title="Second call — should report cache hit"
curl -sSi -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo-caller" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-prod",
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"cached prompt"}]
  }'
```

Look for:

```text
x-aisix-cache: hit
```

The response body is the cached copy of the first response — the upstream was not called.

## Step 4: Send A Different Request — Cache Miss Again

Change the prompt to confirm the fingerprint is not "always hit":

```bash title="Different prompt — should report cache miss"
curl -sSi -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo-caller" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-prod",
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"a different prompt"}]
  }'
```

`x-aisix-cache: miss` proves the cache key reflects the request, not a constant.

## What Just Happened

The proxy hashed the resolved model alias, caller key, and request body for each request. The first call missed the cache and went to the upstream; the second call had the same fingerprint and hit the cache; the third call had a different prompt and therefore a different fingerprint, so it missed again. The upstream saw only two calls instead of three.

This contract is exercised by `tests/e2e/src/cases/cache-policy-e2e.test.ts` (identical-request hit) and `tests/e2e/src/cases/cache-scenarios-e2e.test.ts` (different-prompt miss). Both tests assert the `x-aisix-cache` header values and the upstream `receivedRequests.length` count — the cache header is a published contract that cp-api and the dashboard's `/logs` view depend on.

## Cleanup

```bash title="Delete the cache policy"
curl -sS -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/cache_policies/YOUR_CACHE_POLICY_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY"
```

Use the `id` returned in Step 1. Deleting the policy is enough to disable caching for that scope; the cached entries in memory are dropped when the gateway restarts.

## Variations And Next Steps

- **Target one model only** — set `applies_to: "model:gpt-4o-prod"` to scope the cache to a specific alias.
- **Target one caller** — set `applies_to: "api_key:<api_key_id>"` using the `id` returned from `POST /admin/v1/apikeys`.
- **Tune TTL** — for short-lived agent traces, drop `ttl_seconds` to something like `60`; for FAQ-style traffic, raise it.
- **Stage a policy** — write it with `enabled: false` first, sanity-check the resource shape, then flip it to `true` without delete + recreate.
- **Wire up an observability exporter** to see cache hit-rate as a metric, not just a header. See [Observability Exporters](../configuration/observability-exporters.md) for the resource shape.
