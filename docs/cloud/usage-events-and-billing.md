AISIX Cloud collects usage information from the managed data plane and exposes customer-facing usage and billing workflows above that telemetry.

Current documented behavior includes:

- `/dp/telemetry` ingestion on the control-plane side
- usage-event views surfaced from the control plane
- managed budget enforcement and budget-driven `429` outcomes on real DP traffic

This is where Cloud behavior goes beyond a standalone gateway instance with only local request handling.

## Operational Meaning

In managed mode, the data plane is not only serving traffic. It is also emitting usage-oriented signals back to the control plane.

Those signals support:

- usage visibility
- budget workflows
- billing-oriented control-plane features

## Budget Relationship

The most important customer-visible effect is that managed deployments can apply real budget decisions on data-plane traffic, which can result in `429` denials when a budget policy is exceeded.

## Troubleshooting

### Usage appears incomplete in Cloud

Look first at telemetry delivery and managed data-plane health, not just caller request success.
