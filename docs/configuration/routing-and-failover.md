Routing lets one caller-visible model alias dispatch across multiple direct models.

This is the gateway's current virtual-model mechanism.

Use it when you want to separate the caller contract from the individual upstream target that serves a given request.

A routing alias works across the proxy's passthrough endpoints: `/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI shape), `/v1/messages` (Anthropic shape), `/v1/responses`, and `/v1/messages/count_tokens`. Targets in one group may mix providers — e.g. an OpenAI target and an Anthropic target — and the gateway dispatches each target through the right path regardless of which endpoint the caller used. Both non-streaming and streaming requests fail over across targets. For streaming, failover can fire up to and including the first chunk — a connect failure or a slow first token (see [Timeout-Triggered Failover](#timeout-triggered-failover)) moves to the next target before any bytes reach the caller; once the first chunk is forwarded the response is committed to that target and a later mid-stream failure ends the stream rather than failing over.

`/v1/responses` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens` are provider-restricted (OpenAI-only and Anthropic-only respectively). When a group is used on one of these endpoints, only the targets whose provider matches the endpoint are attempted, in order; if the group has no matching target the request is rejected with a 400.

## Current Strategies

- `failover`
- `round_robin`
- `weighted`

Each strategy answers a different operator question:

- `failover`: what should happen when the primary target is down or retryable-failing
- `round_robin`: how should traffic spread across peers over time
- `weighted`: how should the first target be biased when targets have different desired shares

## Example: Failover Routing

```json title="Routing block"
{
  "routing": {
    "strategy": "failover",
    "targets": [
      { "model": "gpt-4o-primary" },
      { "model": "gpt-4o-secondary" }
    ],
    "retries": 1,
    "max_fallbacks": 1,
    "retry_on_429": true,
    "on_all_filtered": "fail"
  }
}
```

## Strategy Semantics

### `failover`

- starts at the first target every time
- only moves to the next target when the prior attempt fails with a retryable error

Choose this when one target is clearly primary and the others are backups.

### `round_robin`

- advances the starting target for each new request to that virtual model
- fallback still walks forward from that starting point

Choose this when several targets are near-peers and you want simple distribution.

### `weighted`

- uses `weight` only for the first target choice
- fallback then walks forward in declaration order
- missing weights default to `1`

Choose this when you need unequal primary traffic share across targets.

## Retry Behavior

`retries` controls how many extra attempts the proxy makes on the current target before failing over.

`max_fallbacks` controls how many later targets the proxy may attempt after the initial target.

Current rules:

- omitted `retries` means no same-target retry
- omitted `max_fallbacks` means all later targets may be attempted
- `max_fallbacks: 0` disables cross-target failover
- values above later-target count are clamped to the available later targets
- `retry_on_429: true` lets upstream `429` participate in both same-target retry and cross-target failover

The proxy retries only on retryable upstream or transport failures. Upstream `4xx` responses are treated as caller-side problems and do not trigger retry or failover, except optional `429` handling when `retry_on_429` is enabled.

This is an important operational boundary. Routing is not a way to mask bad caller requests or invalid model usage.

## Timeout-Triggered Failover

A target that is *too slow* fails over the same way a target that *errors* does. Slowness is defined per direct target by [`timeout`](models.md#timeouts) (non-streaming) and [`stream_timeout`](models.md#timeouts) (streaming), both in milliseconds.

- **Non-streaming.** If a target doesn't return a complete response within its `timeout`, the gateway abandons it (a `504`-class timeout) and moves to the next target — identical to the retryable-failure path above.
- **Streaming.** `stream_timeout` is a per-chunk read timeout (it resets after each chunk). A timeout on the **first** chunk fires before any bytes reach the caller, so the gateway fails over cleanly to the next target. Once the first chunk has been forwarded the response is committed to that target; a later inter-chunk stall **ends the stream** with an error rather than failing over (the gateway can't un-send bytes already on the wire). When `stream_timeout` is unset, the streaming budget falls back to `timeout`.

Because a timed-out attempt is just another retryable failure, it composes with `retries`, `max_fallbacks`, and the runtime [cooldown](models.md#cooldown) (`trigger_on_timeout`) exactly like a `5xx`. These knobs follow the common OpenAI-proxy `timeout` / `stream_timeout` convention.

## Runtime Filtering

Before dispatch, routing consults direct-model runtime state and produces the actual attempt list in this order:

1. partition targets into `healthy`, `cooldown`, and `unhealthy` based on the runtime status tracker
2. if any healthy targets exist, dispatch to those
3. if no healthy targets exist but at least one target is in `cooldown`, dispatch to every target whose runtime status is not `unhealthy` (cooldown candidates are preferred over background-confirmed-unhealthy ones)
4. if every target is filtered out, apply the routing model's [`on_all_filtered`](#all-targets-filtered-policy) policy

The runtime state itself is exposed on `GET /admin/v1/models/status`.

Source of each state:

- `cooldown` comes from request-path failures on a direct target — see [Models § Cooldown](models.md#cooldown) for the trigger configuration
- `unhealthy` comes from direct-model `background_model_check`
- routing models themselves are never runtime-filtered and report `not_applicable`

### All-Targets-Filtered Policy

`routing.on_all_filtered` decides what happens when step 4 of the filter loop is reached — every candidate is excluded by runtime status:

- `fail` (default) — return `503 all_candidates_unavailable` to the caller with `Retry-After: 30`. Use this when serving a known-broken target is worse than failing fast.
- `original_order` — dispatch to the original target list, in declaration order, ignoring runtime state for this request. Use this when availability matters more than honoring the probe verdict.

The `Retry-After` value on the `fail` path is a coarse fixed hint. By the time the filter reaches this branch, every candidate is in background-unhealthy state with no live cooldown timer to read.

## Design Constraints

- routing targets refer to other model aliases through `targets[].model`
- routing models omit `provider`, `model_name`, and `provider_key_id`
- direct models omit `routing`

## Operator Guidance

- start with direct models first
- add routing only when you have a clear resilience or traffic-shaping goal
- keep target aliases explicit and easy to reason about
- set `retries` and `max_fallbacks` intentionally so resilience does not create surprise cost or latency

## Response Shape

Routing keeps the caller's view of the response stable across failover.

### `response.model`

`response.model` always echoes the **model name the caller put on the request** — for a routing model that is the routing alias itself, not the underlying target's display name and not the upstream provider's raw id.

```http
POST /v1/chat/completions
{ "model": "failover-group-XYZ", ... }
```

```json title="Response body"
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-...",
  "model": "failover-group-XYZ",
  ...
}
```

This holds whether the response came from `targets[0]` on the happy path or from a later target after failover. A cross-provider routing group (e.g. mixing an OpenAI target with an Anthropic target) never leaks the underlying provider's vocabulary into `response.model`.

Direct (non-routing) models follow the same contract — `response.model` echoes the caller's requested name.

### `x-aisix-served-by`

The proxy emits an `x-aisix-served-by` response header on every routing-model response. The value is the display name of the target that actually served the request.

```http title="Response headers"
x-aisix-served-by: gpt-4o-secondary
```

After failover, the value reflects the target whose attempt succeeded — not the target that was tried first and failed. The header is the wire-level signal for "did failover fire, and which target won."

The header applies to successful `/v1/chat/completions` responses. It is **absent** in these cases:

- **Direct (non-routing) models.** The body's `response.model` already names the served model, so the header would be redundant — its presence is itself the routing signal.
- **Cache hits.** A stored response is decoupled from whichever target produced it on the original miss; surfacing a stale name would lie. Operators inspecting routing must look at `x-aisix-cache` first.
- **Error responses** (e.g. failover exhausted, every target unhealthy). No target served the request, so there is no name to report.
- **Other endpoints.** The Anthropic-shape `/v1/messages` path resolves routing groups (including failover) but is on a separate code path and does not currently emit this header.

If a routing target's `display_name` contains bytes that are not valid HTTP header values (CR/LF or non-visible-ASCII), the header is omitted and the DP logs a `tracing::warn!` carrying the offending name. Rename the target with operator-side tools to restore the header.

## Troubleshooting

### Traffic never reaches the secondary target

That may be expected if the primary target is healthy and your strategy is `failover`.

### A request fails on one target and does not fall back

Check whether the failure is retryable. Upstream `4xx` responses do not trigger cross-target retry.

### `response.model` shows the routing alias, not the target that served

That is the documented contract — see [Response Shape](#response-shape). Read `x-aisix-served-by` to learn which target actually served the request.

### `x-aisix-served-by` is missing on a routing-model response

Check the response headers first:

- `x-aisix-cache: hit` — header is intentionally absent on cache hits.
- DP logs for a `tracing::warn!` mentioning `target_display_name` — your target's display name contains characters that are not valid in an HTTP header value. Rename the target.
