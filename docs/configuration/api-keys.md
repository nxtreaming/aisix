API keys are the caller-facing credentials used on the proxy surface.

The gateway does not store plaintext caller keys in the `ApiKey` resource. It stores `key_hash`, which is the SHA-256 hex digest of the plaintext bearer token.

This resource controls who can call the proxy and which model aliases they can use.

## Current Fields

- `key_hash`
- `allowed_models`
- optional `rate_limit`
- optional `team_id`
- optional `owner_id`

Think of those fields as four distinct control layers:

- identity: `key_hash`
- authorization: `allowed_models`
- inline policy: `rate_limit`
- bucket identity: `team_id` and `owner_id`

`team_id` and `owner_id` are not access controls in themselves. They are the bucket keys that `team`-scoped and `member`-scoped [`RateLimitPolicy`](rate-limits.md#rate-limit-policy-entities) rows match against. Set them when you want a policy to span all keys belonging to the same team or to the same member.

## Create A Caller Key

Hash the plaintext key first:

```bash title="Hash a caller API key"
printf 'sk-demo-caller' | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1
```

Then create the admin resource:

```bash title="Create an API key"
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/apikeys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key_hash": "YOUR_CALLER_KEY_HASH",
    "allowed_models": ["gpt-4o-prod"],
    "rate_limit": {
      "rpm": 60,
      "concurrency": 5
    }
  }'
```

The plaintext bearer token is the value your clients will send in `Authorization: Bearer ...`.

## Model Authorization

`allowed_models` controls which model aliases the caller may use.

Current behavior:

- `["*"]` allows access to every model alias visible to that key
- an explicit list allows only those model aliases
- an empty array is valid but denies every model

Choose explicit allowlists unless you intentionally want a wildcard operator or internal key.

## Rotation

`POST /admin/v1/apikeys/:id/rotate` generates a new plaintext bearer, stores only its hash, and returns the plaintext exactly once.

That means rotation is both a security action and a distribution event. You need a plan for getting the new plaintext into the caller before the old one is retired.

Example response shape:

```json
{
  "entry": {
    "id": "...",
    "revision": 2,
    "value": {
      "key_hash": "...",
      "allowed_models": ["gpt-4o-prod"]
    }
  },
  "plaintext": "sk-550e8400e29b41d4a716446655440000"
}
```

## Rate Limits

The inline rate-limit object on `ApiKey` supports:

- `tpm`
- `tpd`
- `rpm`
- `rpd`
- `concurrency`

`ApiKey.rate_limit` is one of three layers the proxy enforces. The other two are `Model.rate_limit` (inline on the resolved model) and standalone `RateLimitPolicy` rows. All applicable layers are AND-combined per request.

See [Rate Limits](rate-limits.md) for the full enforcement model and for `team`/`member`-scope policies that match against `team_id` / `owner_id`.

## Budget Boundary

Managed budget enforcement exists on the managed `/dp/budget_check` path.

Current standalone boundary:

- standalone self-hosted deployments default to a disabled budget client, which is allow-all

## Troubleshooting

### A valid key gets `403`

Check `allowed_models` first. That is an authorization failure, not an authentication failure.

### The caller lost access after rotation

Make sure the client is using the newly returned plaintext key, not the old one.

### Rate-limit behavior is not matching the layer you configured

The proxy combines `ApiKey.rate_limit`, `Model.rate_limit`, and matching `RateLimitPolicy` rows on every request. If a layer looks silent, check whether another layer is the actual gating one — a tighter `ApiKey.rate_limit` will trip before a looser `Model.rate_limit`. See [Rate Limits § Troubleshooting](rate-limits.md#troubleshooting).
