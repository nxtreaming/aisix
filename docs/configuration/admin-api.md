The AISIX AI Gateway admin API is the operator-facing surface for managing the gateway's dynamic configuration.

Use this API when you need to:

- create and update models
- create and rotate caller API keys
- manage upstream provider credentials
- manage guardrails, cache policies, and observability exporters
- inspect operator-facing health

Use it as the write path for standalone deployments, not as a caller-facing integration surface.

## Listener And Auth Model

In standalone mode, the admin API runs on the admin listener configured in bootstrap config.

Admin authentication is static and bootstrap-based for the authenticated operator routes:

- admin keys come from `config.admin.admin_keys`
- `/admin/v1/*` routes expect `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
- `x-api-key` is also accepted as a fallback

The following routes are currently public on the admin listener:

- `GET /livez`
- `GET /metrics`
- `GET /admin/openapi.json`
- `GET /admin/openapi-scalar`

Example:

```bash title="Authenticated admin request"
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY"
```

Operationally, there are two very different key types in this product:

- admin keys for operator access to `/admin/v1/*`
- proxy caller API keys for `/v1/*`

Do not mix them.

## Current Admin Surface

The current admin router exposes:

- `GET /livez`
- `GET /metrics`
- `GET /admin/openapi.json`
- `GET /admin/openapi-scalar`
- `GET|POST /admin/v1/models`
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /admin/v1/models/:id`
- `GET|POST /admin/v1/apikeys`
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /admin/v1/apikeys/:id`
- `POST /admin/v1/apikeys/:id/rotate`
- `GET|POST /admin/v1/provider_keys`
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /admin/v1/provider_keys/:id`
- `GET|POST /admin/v1/guardrails`
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /admin/v1/guardrails/:id`
- `GET|POST /admin/v1/cache_policies`
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /admin/v1/cache_policies/:id`
- `GET|POST /admin/v1/observability_exporters`
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /admin/v1/observability_exporters/:id`
- `GET /admin/v1/health`
- `POST /playground/chat/completions`

Think about these routes in three groups:

- public operator helpers: health, metrics, and OpenAPI discovery
- CRUD resources: models, API keys, provider keys, guardrails, cache policies, exporters
- convenience operator workflow: the in-process playground

## Error Envelope

The admin API does **not** use the OpenAI-style proxy error shape.

It uses a simpler envelope:

```json
{
  "error_msg": "missing or malformed admin authorization"
}
```

Current status behavior includes:

- `400` for bad request or schema validation failure
- `401` for missing or invalid admin auth
- `404` for missing resources
- `409` for conflicts such as duplicate names
- `500` for store failures

Public routes such as `/livez`, `/metrics`, and the OpenAPI endpoints do not require admin auth.

Use `GET /livez` for simple admin-listener reachability. Use `GET /admin/v1/health` when you need authenticated per-model operator health.

For automation, plan to branch on admin status codes and `error_msg`, not on the proxy-side OpenAI-compatible error envelope.

## Models

`/admin/v1/models` manages model resources.

Current behavior:

- POST creates a UUID-backed resource entry
- PUT updates an existing model and bumps revision
- duplicate `display_name` values are rejected

Use model CRUD when you need to change caller-visible routing behavior. A model row is the main bridge between your caller contract and the upstream provider configuration.

Example:

```bash title="Create a model"
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "display_name": "gpt-4o-prod",
    "provider": "openai",
    "model_name": "gpt-4o",
    "provider_key_id": "YOUR_PROVIDER_KEY_ID"
  }'
```

## API Keys

`/admin/v1/apikeys` manages caller-facing API keys.

Important current behavior:

- the stored field is `key_hash`, not plaintext
- `allowed_models` controls model authorization
- `POST /admin/v1/apikeys/:id/rotate` returns a new plaintext key exactly once in the rotation response

This makes API-key creation and rotation an operator workflow with one-time secret reveal semantics. Treat the rotate response as the only chance to capture the new plaintext key.

## Provider Keys

`/admin/v1/provider_keys` manages upstream credentials reused by models.

Current fields include:

- `display_name`
- `secret`
- optional `api_base`

Provider keys should be reused across related models where that matches your operational ownership boundary. That keeps upstream credential rotation separate from model alias changes.

## Guardrails

`/admin/v1/guardrails` manages guardrail resources.

Current resource kinds are:

- `keyword`
- `bedrock`

Current operator guidance:

- use `keyword` for current in-process blocking behavior
- treat `bedrock` as a schema-backed but limited runtime path

Create guardrails only when you are also clear about where they execute today. The current live guardrail path is narrower than the full schema surface.

See [Guardrails](guardrails.md).

## Cache Policies

`/admin/v1/cache_policies` manages cache-policy resources.

Current fields include:

- `name`
- `enabled`
- `backend`
- `ttl_seconds`
- `applies_to`

Current documented `applies_to` forms are:

- `all`
- `model:<display_name>`
- `api_key:<api_key_id>`

Cache policies are a matching layer, not a guarantee that every request will be cached. They must line up with the bootstrap cache backend and the current request shape.

See [Caching](caching.md).

## Observability Exporters

`/admin/v1/observability_exporters` manages exporter resources.

Current behavior:

- `kind=otlp_http` is the supported resource type
- plain `http://` endpoints are rejected unless they are loopback-style development endpoints

Use dynamic exporters when you want request telemetry fan-out to be configurable without restarting the gateway process.

See [Observability Exporters](observability-exporters.md).

## Health, Metrics, And Playground

### `GET /admin/v1/health`

This is the operator-facing health endpoint.

It reports top-level health plus current model health state.

Use it to answer operator questions such as:

- is the admin surface alive
- does the process have a current snapshot
- are configured models currently healthy from the gateway's point of view

### `GET /metrics`

This is the Prometheus scrape endpoint on the admin listener.

### `POST /playground/chat/completions`

The standalone admin playground is an in-process proxy to `/v1/chat/completions`.

Important current behavior:

- it expects a **proxy** API key, not an admin key
- it forwards into the proxy router inside the same process
- it runs the full proxy middleware path

This is useful for operator debugging because it exercises the normal proxy stack while avoiding a separate client setup step.

## Verification

Verify that the admin surface is reachable:

```bash title="Check admin health"
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY"
```

Then create a provider key, model, and API key as shown in [First Model, First Key, First Request](../quickstart/first-model-first-key-first-request.md).

## Troubleshooting

### `401` on `/admin/v1/*`

Check the bootstrap admin key first. Do not test with a proxy caller key.

### A resource is created but proxy traffic still fails

That is usually a configuration propagation delay, not a failed admin write.

### `409` on create

The most common cause is a duplicate logical name such as `display_name`.
