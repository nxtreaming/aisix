## Reading Tips

- when a page says `caller-facing`, it refers to the client contract on `/v1/*`
- when a page says `operator-facing`, it refers to the standalone admin or Cloud control surface
- when a page says `projected`, it means control-plane state has been materialized into the data-plane snapshot
