# Admin API

The Admin API is the operator surface served on the admin listener
(default `:3001`). It owns CRUD for every configurable entity, the
playground proxy, the embedded SPA, the OpenAPI Scalar UI, and the
Prometheus scrape endpoint.

> **Network posture**: the admin listener is intended to be private —
> bind it to `127.0.0.1` or to a private subnet. The proxy listener
> is the public surface.

## 1. Authentication

Every `/admin/v1/*` endpoint requires an admin key, presented as
either:

- `Authorization: Bearer <admin-key>` (preferred), or
- `x-api-key: <admin-key>` (fallback for clients that can't set
  `Authorization`).

When both headers are present, `Authorization` wins. Admin keys are
configured in the bootstrap YAML under `admin.admin_keys` (a list).

The unauthenticated endpoints are:

- `/health` — liveness probe.
- `/metrics` — Prometheus scrape (intended to be private).
- `/admin/openapi.json`, `/admin/openapi-scalar` — the OpenAPI spec
  and the Scalar UI.
- `/ui`, `/ui/`, `/ui/*` — the embedded React SPA. The SPA
  authenticates against the API by storing the admin key in
  `localStorage` and sending it with every request.

## 2. Error envelope

Admin errors use a deliberately simpler envelope than the proxy:

```json
{"error_msg": "name 'my-gpt4' already exists"}
```

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| 400 | Validation failed (missing required field, wrong type, schema rejection) |
| 401 | Missing or unknown admin key |
| 403 | Reserved for future per-key admin RBAC |
| 404 | Resource id not found |
| 409 | Duplicate name on POST or PUT-create |
| 500 | Internal error (etcd unavailable, etc.) |

## 3. Resource model

Every CRUD endpoint shares the same response shape:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "value": { …entity… },
  "revision": 42
}
```

Lists wrap items in `{"items": [...]}`. The `revision` field is the
etcd mod-revision at write time — useful for optimistic concurrency
in custom tooling.

## 4. Endpoints

### 4.1 Models — `/admin/v1/models`

The Model entity. See `crates/aisix-core/src/models/model.rs` for the
full schema.

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/admin/v1/models` | — | `{items: [{id, value: Model, revision}]}` |
| POST | `/admin/v1/models` | Model JSON | `{id, value, revision}` (id is server-assigned UUID v4) |
| GET | `/admin/v1/models/{id}` | — | `{id, value, revision}` |
| PUT | `/admin/v1/models/{id}` | Model JSON | `{id, value, revision}` (idempotent — first call 201, subsequent 200) |
| DELETE | `/admin/v1/models/{id}` | — | `{deleted: true}` |

POST + PUT both reject duplicate `name` with 409.

```bash
# Create a Model that wraps OpenAI's gpt-4o behind alias "my-gpt4"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/admin/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-gpt4",
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "provider_config": {
      "api_key": "sk-real-openai-…",
      "api_base": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    },
    "rate_limit": {"rpm": 100, "tpm": 100000},
    "cost": {"input_per_1k": 0.005, "output_per_1k": 0.015}
  }'
```

### 4.2 ApiKeys — `/admin/v1/apikeys`

Caller-facing keys. Empty `allowed_models` denies every model — it is
**not** a shortcut for "all". Use `["*"]` for wildcard.

| Method | Path |
|---|---|
| GET | `/admin/v1/apikeys` |
| POST | `/admin/v1/apikeys` |
| GET | `/admin/v1/apikeys/{id}` |
| PUT | `/admin/v1/apikeys/{id}` |
| DELETE | `/admin/v1/apikeys/{id}` |
| POST | `/admin/v1/apikeys/{id}/rotate` — returns a new `key` value, invalidates the old |

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/admin/v1/apikeys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key": "sk-aisix-app-prod",
    "allowed_models": ["my-gpt4"],
    "rate_limit": {"rpm": 60, "concurrency": 10},
    "max_budget_usd": 500.0
  }'
```

### 4.3 Credentials — `/admin/v1/credentials`

Centralised credential list (spec §3.8). Use this when multiple
Models share the same upstream provider key — the Model can then
reference the credential by id rather than embedding the secret.

| Method | Path |
|---|---|
| GET / POST | `/admin/v1/credentials` |
| GET / PUT / DELETE | `/admin/v1/credentials/{id}` |

### 4.4 Budgets — `/admin/v1/budgets`

Per-ApiKey monthly USD spend cap (spec §3.4). The proxy reads the
budget at request start (pre-check) and adds the cost at end of
request.

| Method | Path |
|---|---|
| GET / POST | `/admin/v1/budgets` |
| GET / PUT / DELETE | `/admin/v1/budgets/{id}` |

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/admin/v1/budgets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "api_key_id": "uuid-of-apikey",
    "monthly_usd_cap": 1000.0,
    "usd_per_1k_tokens": 0.01
  }'
```

### 4.5 Teams — `/admin/v1/teams`

Group of ApiKeys with shared rate limits and credential overrides
(spec §3.8).

| Method | Path |
|---|---|
| GET / POST | `/admin/v1/teams` |
| GET / PUT / DELETE | `/admin/v1/teams/{id}` |

### 4.6 Health — `GET /admin/v1/health`

Per-Model health from the in-process `HealthTracker`:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "models": [
    {"id": "uuid", "name": "my-gpt4", "health": 0},
    {"id": "uuid", "name": "my-claude", "health": 1}
  ]
}
```

`health` is `0` (Healthy), `1` (Degraded — 4–7 consecutive upstream
failures), or `2` (Down — 8+).

### 4.7 Spend — `GET /admin/v1/spend`

Current-month accumulated USD spend per ApiKey from the in-process
`BudgetTracker`. Returns the period (`YYYY-MM`) plus per-key entries.

```json
{
  "period": "2026-04",
  "entries": [
    {"api_key_id": "uuid", "spend_usd": 12.34}
  ]
}
```

### 4.8 Playground — `POST /playground/chat/completions`

Proxies a chat completion through the proxy router **in-process** —
no extra network hop, but the request is fully audited as if it had
arrived on the proxy listener. Use this for the "Try it" panel in
the admin UI.

This endpoint expects a **proxy** API key (an `ApiKey` from the
snapshot), not an admin key. The admin key only protects the rest
of `/admin/v1/*`.

### 4.9 OpenAPI

- `GET /admin/openapi.json` — machine-readable OpenAPI 3 document
  generated by `utoipa` from the same handler signatures.
- `GET /admin/openapi-scalar` — Scalar HTML UI for browsing /
  trying the API.

These are unauthenticated by design: knowing the API surface should
not require credentials.

### 4.10 Embedded SPA

- `GET /ui` → `303 /ui/`
- `GET /ui/` → `index.html` (text/html)
- `GET /ui/*path` → static asset, falling back to `index.html` for
  unknown paths so client-side routes work.

## 5. Working with the snapshot

Admin writes are NOT immediately visible to the proxy. The flow is:

1. Admin handler validates the body, generates a UUID (POST) or
   resolves an id (PUT/DELETE).
2. Handler writes to etcd transactionally.
3. The watch supervisor observes the change (~50 ms typical).
4. The supervisor publishes a new `AisixSnapshot` via `ArcSwap`.
5. Subsequent proxy requests see the change.

End-to-end the propagation is bounded at 500 ms in practice. The
E2E harness sleeps 500 ms between Admin write and Proxy assertion;
production tooling should do the same when chaining writes.

## 6. Versioning

Admin endpoints live under `/admin/v1/`. The same compatibility
rules as the proxy API apply: optional fields are added without
breaking existing clients; removed fields stay accepted-but-ignored
for at least one minor version. A v2 surface, when needed, will
mount in parallel.

  supervisor.

  browsable at `/admin/openapi-scalar`).
