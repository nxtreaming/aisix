Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Bias toward caution over speed; for trivial tasks, use judgment. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

- State assumptions explicitly; if uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop, name what's confusing, and ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked; no abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it. Would a senior engineer call it overcomplicated? Then simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting; don't refactor what isn't broken; match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- Remove imports/variables/functions YOUR changes orphaned — but don't delete pre-existing dead code; mention it instead.
- The test: every changed line traces directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

- Turn tasks into verifiable goals: "add validation" → write tests for invalid inputs, then pass them; "fix the bug" → write a reproducing test first; "refactor X" → tests pass before and after.
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan as `step → verify: check` lines.
- Strong criteria let you loop independently; weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Testing Discipline

**E2E tests are the highest-priority signal. Cover the real user journey. Never silence failures.**

- Prioritize E2E over unit/integration when coverage is limited; design cases around the user's real path and don't skip steps.
- For any frontend UI, write E2E with **Playwright**, issuing requests to a **real backend API** — no stubbed network, fixture servers, or intercepted responses.
- Don't use mock data in E2E; run against real data and services. If mocking seems unavoidable, stop and get human confirmation first.
- Never skip, disable, or `.only` a test to go green — investigate the underlying bug instead.
- E2E tests must be **source-blind**: design assertions from scenario reasonableness alone, never by reading product source to pick expected values. The test verifies the observable contract, not the implementation.
- **If an E2E test fails, the default conclusion is a bug in the code, not the test.** Fix the product; don't weaken the assertion, relax the expected value, change the scenario, or read the source to explain it away. Only change a failing test if a human confirms the scenario is invalid.
- If a test case itself looks wrong, flag it and ask a human — don't silently delete or rewrite it.

## 6. Research Discipline

**Verify against primary sources. Never guess or infer product behavior.**

- Confirm details only via **official documentation** and **source code**; don't speculate or fill gaps with assumptions.
- If docs and source don't answer it, say so and ask — don't invent an answer.
- Cite the specific doc URL, file path, or commit/version for any claim about third-party behavior.

## 7. Reference Implementations Before Building

**Before implementing any feature, study how the established players did it — don't drift from the ecosystem.**

Before writing the first line of a new feature, read:

- **Mainstream AI gateway implementations** — research at least three established, mainstream AI gateways and study how each solves the problem. When in doubt about a request/response transform, read their sources for the same provider + endpoint and compare.
- **Upstream provider docs** — the authoritative spec for any endpoint: OpenAI <https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference>, Anthropic <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api>, Gemini <https://ai.google.dev/api>, DeepSeek <https://api-docs.deepseek.com>, Bedrock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/>.
- **Upstream SDK source** — the real contract when docs are vague (`usage` sub-fields, streaming event order, error envelopes): the official `openai-python`, `anthropic-sdk-python`, and `generative-ai-python` repos.

The rule:

- For any new endpoint, request transform, or response normalization, compare how at least three mainstream gateways approach it, cite one upstream-spec source, and summarize that comparison — plus where your design lands — in the design notes / PR description.
- If your design diverges from how those gateways solve it, name the divergence and justify it ("they do X but we need Y because of Z" — not "I didn't know they handled it").
- For any field, header, or status code you emit or parse, cite the upstream doc URL or SDK file/line. Don't invent names the ecosystem has already chosen.
- Refer to other products generically in shipped artifacts (code, comments, commit messages, PR descriptions) — describe the approach, not the brand. Keep brand-specific notes to internal design discussion.

## 8. Independent Audit Before Merge

**Every PR pushed must be reviewed by an independent audit agent. Merge is blocked until all HIGH/MEDIUM findings are resolved or explicitly justified.**

After every `gh pr create` or force-push, spawn a fresh `general-purpose` Agent with no shared context. Brief it cold with the PR URL and the contract the PR claims to pin. Treat each angle as blocking:

- **Correctness** — does it do what the description claims? Would a real regression fail the assertions?
- **Reliability** — races, error handling, retry/timeout, propagation timing on slow CI.
- **Security** — auth/authz, input validation at boundaries, injection, header forwarding (and what's deliberately not forwarded).
- **Sensitive-info leakage** — secrets in logs/errors, internal taxonomy or upstream-provider details in user-facing fields, tokens/PII in fixtures.
- **Breaking changes** — API shape, on-disk format, wire protocol, default shifts; if breaking, is it gated/versioned?
- **E2E coverage** — the user-visible contract, not just unit happy-path; mocks tight enough that a regression on the unverified side can't sneak through.

Output HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW per finding with **concrete suggested code**, not vague "consider". **Merge gate:** every HIGH and MEDIUM is either fixed in code or explicitly justified in the PR (e.g. "feature gap, filed as #N, agreed not to block"); silent merge is not enough. For findings that surface gateway/product-behavior gaps, file separate issues and link them. Self-review misses the author's blind spots — an independent agent catches them.

## Handler Families Stay in Lockstep — Fix the Whole Class

**The client-facing endpoint handlers come in families that share dispatch, auth, routing, telemetry, and guardrail logic — `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages` (+`count_tokens`), `/v1/responses`, plus embeddings/rerank/audio/images. A bug or feature landed on one almost always applies to the others, and a gap on the unfixed siblings is SILENT: nothing errors, the behavior just quietly degrades.**

- When you touch a per-request mechanism (a runtime metric, a limit, an auth check, a usage emission, header threading), grep the offending call/pattern across the whole crate and wire **every** sibling path in the same PR — both streaming and non-streaming branches — or state explicitly in the PR which sibling is deferred and why, and file the follow-up issue immediately.
- "Documented follow-up" without an issue is how gaps rot: it lives in one PR description and no one ever comes back.
- Test coverage must include each wired endpoint, not just chat: an e2e that only drives `/v1/chat/completions` will stay green forever while Anthropic-SDK (`/v1/messages`) and Codex (`/v1/responses`) traffic silently misbehaves.
- Prefer hoisting the shared logic into one chokepoint (e.g. `resolve_attempt_models`) so the family can't drift again.

(Two recurrences of the same lesson: #471 — a Model-Group dispatch fix landed only on `/v1/messages` while `/v1/responses` and `count_tokens` had the identical gap; then #715 — `least_busy`'s in-flight counter shipped fed by chat.rs only (#684 left messages/responses as an un-filed "follow-up"), so the strategy silently degraded to declaration order for Claude Code / Codex traffic until #716. The EWMA for `least_latency` (#682) wired all three endpoints at once and never had this problem — that's the standard.)

## A Config Knob Isn't Shipped Until the Control Plane Exposes It

**A user-configurable data-plane feature is NOT delivered when the Rust side works — it's delivered when a user can reach it through the control plane. DP-only is a half-feature nobody can turn on.**

This repo reads its config from etcd, but users never write etcd directly — the **control plane** (`api7/AISIX-Cloud`, a separate repo) is the only writer. That CP is **not a passthrough**: it validates every resource against a **closed** OpenAPI schema (`control-plane/openapi/cp-admin.yaml`) and its validator **rejects any field or enum value the spec doesn't list, before it is ever written to etcd**. So the moment you add a new config surface here — a new `RoutingStrategy` variant, a new per-target field, a new resource knob, a header-driven behavior a user is expected to configure on a resource — a DP that happily reads it from etcd is still **unreachable**, because the CP will never let that value through and no UI offers it.

- **Treat any DP PR that adds or extends a user-facing config surface as automatically implying a paired CP PR.** The DP change is not "done" on its own; it's one half of a cross-plane feature. Before calling a routing/resource/config feature complete, confirm the CP can accept and persist the new shape.
- **"Done" for such a feature spans four CP layers**, none optional: (1) the `cp-admin.yaml` schema (new enum value / field) **and its regenerated Go bindings**; (2) the Go typed model + request validation + etcd projection under `internal/cpapi/resources/`; (3) the dashboard form field(s) under `dashboard/` **plus `messages/en.json` + `zh.json` i18n**; (4) paired tests — CP↔DP Go integration in `e2e/cases/` and Playwright for the UI.
- **If you can only do the DP half in this PR, say so and file/track the CP issue in the same breath** — never let the umbrella task close on DP-only work. A merged DP PR with no CP counterpart is a latent gap, not a shipped feature.
- Pure internal DP mechanics (a new algorithm with no user-set config, an observability metric, an internal refactor) don't need CP work — this rule is specifically about **user-configurable** surfaces a customer must be able to set.

(Lesson from AISIX-Cloud#873 routing: `least_cost` / `least_latency` / `least_busy`, per-target `tags`, and `sticky` canary all shipped DP-only across #681/#682/#684/#686/#687 while `cp-admin.yaml` still pinned the closed `[round_robin, weighted, failover]` enum and the dashboard had no fields — so none of it was actually usable until the matching CP integration landed. The meta-repo `AGENTS.md` carries the same rule for cross-plane agents.)

## Documentation Lives in api7/docs

**User-facing documentation is maintained in the `api7/docs` repository (published to <https://docs.api7.ai/ai-gateway/>), not in this repo.**

- This repo's source tree intentionally carries **no** user-facing doc pages — they were migrated to `api7/docs` so one site stays authoritative and never drifts from a stale in-repo copy. Do not add or keep prose docs under `docs/` here.
- When a feature needs documentation, add or update the page in `api7/docs` and link to its `docs.api7.ai` URL (e.g. from the README) — never re-introduce a `docs/*.md` page in this repo, even temporarily or "just for now".
- Only user-facing *prose* moves out. Code-level doc comments stay with the code — including the generated API reference below.

## Generated API Documentation

**Some source comments are rendered into user-facing API references.**

When editing Admin API resource models under `crates/aisix-core/src/models` or OpenAPI assembly in `crates/aisix-admin/src/openapi.rs`:

- Write descriptions as public API reference text, not internal implementation notes.
- Avoid internal shorthand such as DP, CP, kine row, wire shape, mock server, bridge dispatch, or issue-only context.
- Avoid excessive inline code. Use it only for exact field names, enum values, routes, headers, environment variables, and literal response values.
- Do not describe stable defaults only in prose. Expose them as OpenAPI `default` values when the runtime behavior has a fixed default.
- For computed fallback behavior, describe what happens when the field is omitted instead of calling it a schema default.
- Regenerate resource schemas with `cargo run -p aisix-core --bin dump-schema` after changing model comments.
- Verify the generated Admin API OpenAPI with `cargo run -p aisix-admin --bin dump-openapi > /tmp/admin-api.openapi.json` after changing Admin API routes, OpenAPI metadata, or generated descriptions.
- Preview or inspect the served OpenAPI when changing generated descriptions.

**Working if:** fewer unnecessary diff lines, fewer overcomplication rewrites, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
