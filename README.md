---

**AISIX AI Gateway** is a Rust-native gateway that puts a single, OpenAI-compatible API in
front of every LLM provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI,
DeepSeek, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. It gives platform teams one place to route,
govern, secure, and observe LLM traffic, with first-class SSE streaming and low gateway
overhead.

It runs as a **single static binary** — low cold-start, lock-free config reads, dynamic
configuration over etcd with no restarts. Run it **self-hosted and free**, or connect it to
**[AISIX Cloud](https://api7.ai/ai-gateway?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloud)**
for a managed control plane with team governance, budgets, audit, and a dashboard.

> **AISIX AI Gateway (this repo)** is the open-source core — the gateway/data plane.
> **[AISIX Cloud](https://api7.ai/ai-gateway?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloud)**
> is the managed SaaS that adds the multi-tenant control plane on top. The proxy API is
> identical in both. **New to AISIX Cloud? [Start free →](https://api7.ai/ai-gateway?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloud)**

## ⚡ Quickstart

AISIX is etcd-backed, so the fastest local run is Docker Compose (gateway + etcd). Grab the
ready-to-run `docker-compose.yml` and example `config.yaml` from the
[self-hosted quickstart](https://docs.api7.ai/ai-gateway/quickstart/), then:

```bash
docker compose up          # proxy → :3000, admin API → :3001
```

Configure a model and an API key through the admin API on `:3001`
([quickstart](https://docs.api7.ai/ai-gateway/quickstart/)),
then call the gateway exactly like OpenAI:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISIX_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"my-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

## ✨ Why AISIX

- **One API, every model.** Speak the OpenAI *or* Anthropic wire format in; the gateway
  translates to whichever provider each model points at. Point an OpenAI or Claude SDK at
  one `base_url` and switch models without changing code.
- **A real gateway, in Rust.** Single static binary, low cold-start, lock-free config reads
  on the hot path, native streaming.
- **Open-source core, free forever.** Apache-2.0, self-hostable end to end. Reach for
  AISIX Cloud only when you want the managed control plane.
- **Production controls built in.** Routing & failover, rate limits, budgets, guardrails,
  caching, and observability ship in the box.

## 🧩 Features — available today

Covered by 90+ E2E tests.

- **OpenAI-compatible proxy** (`:3000`) — `chat/completions`, `responses`, `embeddings`,
  `rerank`, `images/generations`, `audio/{speech,transcriptions,translations}`,
  `GET /v1/models`, and a `passthrough/:provider/*` escape hatch. Native SSE streaming,
  tool/function calling, JSON mode, vision/multimodal input, and reasoning-content support.
- **Anthropic Messages API** — `POST /v1/messages` as a first-class route, working against
  **any** configured upstream: requests and responses (including streaming) are translated
  both ways when a model points at a non-Anthropic provider.
- **Routing & failover** — virtual/routing models, weighted load balancing, automatic
  failover, retry budgets, cooldowns, and per-attempt timeouts.
- **Semantic routing** — one virtual model that dispatches by the *meaning* of each
  request: it embeds the prompt, scores it against per-route example utterances, and routes
  to the best match (or a default). See the
  [semantic routing docs](https://docs.api7.ai/ai-gateway/routing-and-resilience/semantic-routing).
- **Rate limiting & concurrency** — RPM/RPD + TPM/TPD + concurrency caps, AND-combined
  across `ApiKey`, `Model`, and policy scopes (`api_key` / `model` / `team` / `member`).
- **Guardrails** — content-policy enforcement on input and output: keyword/regex
  (in-process), AWS Bedrock Guardrails, Azure AI Content Safety (Prompt Shield + text
  moderation), and Aliyun content moderation. A block returns `422 content_filter`.
- **Caching** — exact-match response cache with per-policy TTL and model/key scope matchers;
  memory and Redis backends; cost-saved telemetry on every hit.
- **Observability** — Prometheus `/metrics`, structured per-request access logs, usage
  events, OTLP/GenAI span export (Langfuse, Honeycomb, Grafana Cloud, or any OTLP receiver),
  plus dedicated Datadog and Aliyun SLS log exporters and object-storage (S3/GCS/Azure Blob)
  telemetry.
- **Admin API** (`:3001`) — JSON-Schema-validated CRUD for every resource, OpenAPI 3 with a
  Scalar UI at `/admin/openapi-scalar`, per-model upstream health, and a built-in playground.

## 🔌 Supported providers

AISIX dispatches through **five native adapter families** — distinct wire-protocol bridges,
not one generic relabel. Whatever the upstream protocol, the client-facing API stays
OpenAI-shaped.

| Adapter family | Reaches | Wire shape · auth |
|---|---|---|
| `openai` | OpenAI **+ any OpenAI-compatible vendor** — DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, Together, Fireworks, Perplexity, vLLM, Ollama, self-hosted | OpenAI chat completions · Bearer |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic Claude | Anthropic Messages · `x-api-key` |
| `bedrock` | AWS Bedrock — Anthropic, Meta Llama, Mistral, Cohere, Amazon Titan/Nova, AI21 | Bedrock Converse + `/invoke` · SigV4 |
| `vertex` | Google Vertex AI (Gemini) | Vertex `:generateContent` · OAuth2 |
| `azure-openai` | Azure OpenAI | Azure deployments · api-key / Entra ID |

Plus specialized handling for vendor quirks (e.g. DeepSeek reasoning content) and dedicated
**rerank / embeddings** vendors (Cohere, Jina). Details in
[adapter protocol families](https://docs.api7.ai/ai-gateway/reference/adapters). More providers on the
[roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## ☁️ Self-hosted vs AISIX Cloud

Same gateway binary, same proxy API. **AISIX Cloud** adds the managed control plane on top.

Highlights on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md); tracked live in
[issues](https://github.com/api7/aisix/issues):

- 100+ additional provider integrations (Together, Fireworks, Replicate, …)
- Semantic (embedding-similarity) caching + pgvector backend
- More guardrails — Lakera, Presidio, OpenAI Moderation, Llama-Guard
- More observability sinks — Langsmith, Helicone, Slack alerts
- JWT / OIDC auth for proxy clients (Entra ID, Okta, Google Workspace)
- Distributed (Redis-backed) rate limiting
- MCP gateway — registration, transports, auth, cost tracking

## 🛠️ Development

Prerequisites: the Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`, plus Docker (for etcd).

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace

# Coverage (matches the CI gate)
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --lcov --output-path lcov.info

# Run locally (needs a reachable etcd + a config.yaml — see the docs quickstart)
cargo run -p aisix-server --bin aisix -- --config config.yaml
```
