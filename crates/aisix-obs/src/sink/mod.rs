//! Pluggable observability-sink framework — the capability-typed adapter
//! contract that the shared delivery pipeline drives.
//!
//! One implementation per sink *family* (`http_batch`, `object_store`,
//! `warehouse_stream`, `otlp`); per-vendor behaviour (Aliyun SLS, Datadog,
//! …) is configuration plus pluggable encoder/signer traits, not a new
//! sink. The shared pipeline owns batching, retry/backoff, backpressure and
//! per-sink delivery state; a sink only encodes a batch and reports the
//! outcome.
//!
//! This module is the framework foundation (AISIX-Cloud#692, phase F1): the
//! trait + capability matrix + idempotency types. The shared pipeline (F2)
//! and the concrete sinks (SLS, …) build on it.
