//! `ObservabilityExporter` — env-scoped fan-out target the DP ships
//! per-request telemetry to.
//!
//! cp-api writes one row per configured exporter to
//! `/aisix/<env>/observability_exporters/<uuid>`; the DP loads them on
//! the watch and composes a fan-out sink that runs alongside the
//! existing `usage::UsageSink` (which still feeds the cp-api telemetry
//! pipeline). The DP is the authoritative consumer of these configs —
//! cp-api never opens an HTTP connection to the user's exporter
//! endpoint, which is the whole reason for DP-direct egress (sensitive
//! prompt / response content stays on the data plane).
//!
//! Kinds: `otlp_http` (Tempo / Loki / Jaeger / Honeycomb / Grafana Cloud /
//! Langfuse-via-OTLP — anything speaking OTLP/HTTP) and `aliyun_sls`
//! (Aliyun SLS PutLogs). Further targets (Datadog / S3 / …) land as
//! additional kinds.
//!
//! Wire shape on kine — flat object with the kind-tagged config fields
//! at top level, matching the `Guardrail` pattern in this crate:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "name": "honeycomb-prod",
//!   "enabled": true,
//!   "kind": "otlp_http",
//!   "endpoint": "https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/traces",
