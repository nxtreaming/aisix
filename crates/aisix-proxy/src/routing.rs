//! Per-virtual-model routing state + target selection.
//!
//! When a request lands on a Model with `routing` configured, the proxy
//! asks the [`RoutingRegistry`] for an iterator of underlying target
//! Model names in attempt-order. The registry owns the per-virtual-
//! model state (round-robin counter, weighted PRNG seed); selection
//! itself is pure given that state.
//!
//! Strategies (spec §3.5):
//! - **failover**: always start at `targets[0]`, walk forward on failure.
//! - **round_robin**: each *new* request advances a per-model counter
//!   so callers spread evenly across targets.
//! - **weighted**: pick a starting target with probability proportional
//!   to `weight`, then walk forward on failure (weights only affect the
//!   *first* attempt — once we're falling back, order is positional).
