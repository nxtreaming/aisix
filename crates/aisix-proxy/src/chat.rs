//! 1. [`AuthenticatedKey`] extractor runs first — rejects unauthenticated

//! 2. Parse [`ChatFormat`] from the JSON body.
//! 3. Resolve `req.model` against the snapshot's Model table → 404 if
//!    absent.
//! 4. Check the ApiKey's `allowed_models` whitelist → 403 if disallowed.
//! 5. Look up the matching `Bridge` on the Hub by `Model::provider()` →
//!    503 if no bridge registered.
//! 6. Rate-limit pre-commit; build [`BridgeContext`] and dispatch:
