//! Per-chunk read-timeout combinators for streaming upstreams (#554).
//!
//! Mirrors the common OpenAI-proxy `stream_timeout` semantics: the deadline bounds the
//! wait for EACH chunk — the first one and every inter-chunk gap — and
//! resets after each successful read. A *first-chunk* timeout lets the
//! caller fail over before any bytes reach the client (issue AC2); a
//! *mid-stream* timeout terminates the stream like any other upstream
//! error, because once the `200` is committed a clean fallback is no
//! longer possible.
//!
//! Two flavours:
//! - [`with_read_timeout`] for the typed [`ChatChunkStream`] path
//!   (`/v1/chat/completions`, cross-provider `/v1/messages`): a read
//!   timeout surfaces as [`BridgeError::Timeout`], which the SSE pump
//!   already renders as an error frame.
//! - [`with_read_timeout_bytes`] for the raw byte passthroughs
//!   (`/v1/responses`, native-Anthropic `/v1/messages`): a read timeout
//!   simply ends the forwarded byte stream (the client sees a truncated
//!   response); there is no in-band error frame to inject into an opaque
//!   passthrough.
//!
//! [`send_with_deadline`] bounds the connect phase of a raw passthrough so
//! a slow upstream that never returns response headers also fails over.
